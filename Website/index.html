        Short quotation. <q>To err is human</q> - Alexander Pope

        <p>
            Albert Ensteinonce said <hr><blockquote>The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery each day.</blockquote><hr>
